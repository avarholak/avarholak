I am currently a student at Stonehill College studying environmental science, religious studies, and data analytics. I am interested in using data science practices to clean, organize, and present data collected in the field. I am currently working on a research project focused on pollinator mediated plasticity in floral traits.

In the future, I hope to further my education and get my masters degree, explore new research opportunities in biology and environmental science, and find a job that involves data analytics in combination with environmental science and/or religious studies. 

For examples of my work, please visit my [portfolio repository](https://github.com/avarholak/portfolio). This repository includes code written for homework assignments for Bio316 (R for Biologists) such as Varholak_week4, as well as a function tutorial for three different R functions (Varholak_function_tutorial).
